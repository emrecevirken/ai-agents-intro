# Introduction to AI Agents

## What is an AI Agent?
An **Agent** is a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines **reasoning, planning, and execution of actions** (often via external tools) to fulfill tasks.

### Components of an Agent:
1. **The Brain (AI Model)**
   - Handles reasoning and planning.
   - Decides which actions to take based on the situation.

2. **The Body (Capabilities and Tools)**
   - Represents everything the agent is equipped to do.
   - Tools enable agents to perform specific actions (e.g., sending an email, searching the web, generating images).

## What AI Models Are Used for Agents?
The most common AI models found in Agents are **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, which process and generate text. Examples include:
- **GPT-4** (OpenAI)
- **Llama** (Meta)
- **Gemini** (Google)

In addition, **Vision Language Models (VLMs)** allow agents to process images alongside text.

## How Do AI Agents Take Actions?
LLMs can generate text, but they require **Tools** to interact with the real world.
For example, when ChatGPT generates an image, it calls an **Image Generation Tool** behind the scenes.

Example Python function for sending an email:

```python
def send_message_to(recipient, message):
    """Useful to send an e-mail message to a recipient"""
    ...

send_message_to("Manager", "Can we postpone today's meeting?")
```

The LLM generates the code to use the tool when needed, allowing real-world interaction.

## Example Use Cases
### 1. Personal Virtual Assistants
- Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant work as agents when they interact with digital environments on behalf of users.

### 2. Customer Service Chatbots
- AI-powered chatbots can answer customer queries, troubleshoot problems, and even process transactions.

### 3. AI NPCs in Video Games
- AI-driven Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) enhance realism by generating adaptive, dynamic responses in video games.

## Summary
An **AI Agent** is a system that uses an **AI Model (LLM)** as its core reasoning engine to:
- **Understand natural language**: Interpret and respond to human instructions.
- **Reason and plan**: Make decisions and strategize solutions.
- **Interact with its environment**: Take actions using tools and observe results.

This knowledge is foundational for building AI Agents using libraries like **smolagents, LangChain, and LlamaIndex**. ðŸš€
